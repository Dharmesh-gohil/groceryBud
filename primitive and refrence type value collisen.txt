In JavaScript, simple values such as numbers, 
booleans, and strings are stored in memory as primitive values. 
Complex values, such as objects and arrays, are stored in memory 
as reference values.

Primitive values are stored directly in memory, 
whereas reference values are stored as a reference to a location 
in memory where the actual value is stored. 
When you create a variable that references a complex value, 
the variable doesn't actually store the value itself, 
but rather a reference to where that value is stored in memory.

Here is an example to illustrate the difference:

// Primitive value
let x = 10;
 
// Complex value
let y = { name: "John", age: 30 };
In the above example, the variable x stores the 
primitive value 10, whereas the variable y stores a 
reference to a location in memory where the object 
{ name: "John", age: 30 } is stored.

This difference in how values are stored can potentially lead to bugs
 in your code. For example, consider the following code:

let a = { value: 10 };
let b = a;
b.value = 20;
console.log(a.value); // Output: 20
In this example, we create an object a with a property value of 10,
 and then create another variable b and set it equal to a. We then 
change the value of b.value to 20, and finally log the value of 
a.value to the console.

Because a and b reference the same object in memory, 
changing the value of b.value also changes the value of 
a.value. This can be problematic if you are not aware of 
how values are stored in memory, as it can lead to unexpected 
behavior in your code.

To avoid this kind of bug, it is important to be aware of the 
difference between simple values and complex values, and to 
understand how values are stored in memory. It is also a 
good practice to avoid directly modifying objects that are passed 
as arguments or returned from functions, as this can also lead to 
unexpected behavior due to the reference nature of complex values 
in JavaScript.
